## ‚ö†Ô∏è Disclaimer

This template is designed to stay cutting-edge, which means it:

    May not suit all workflows due to frequent updates with the latest tools and features.
    Focuses on Client-Side Rendering (CSR) for SPAs. For SSR/SSG, consider using frameworks like:
        Next.js
        Remix (React Router 7)
        TanStack Start (beta).
    Includes experimental features that are tested but could still pose compatibility risks.

## üìö Documentation

### Preretirement

Latest lts for node js, and pnpm installed.

### Getting Started

Two options here either use github's `Use this template` button or do it by cloning the code, there is a script to help clean up git and setup it up.

```bash
# Clone the repository
git clone https://github.com/FerMPY/react-ts-template.git my-app

# Navigate to project directory
cd my-app

# Install dependencies
pnpm install

# CLean up git
pnpm node --experimental-strip-types ./scripts/setup.ts

# Start development server
pnpm dev
```

### Available Scripts

### Performance Optimizations

- ‚ö° Route-based code splitting
- üîÑ Optimistic updates with TanStack Query
- üì¶ Tree-shaking for smaller bundles
- üéØ Type-only imports
- üöÄ React Compiler optimizations

### Testing

This template comes with a little helper `render-with-router` to help with writing tests with Tanstack Router, this comes with 2 options withUser that will add a user so you can run the tests and a with withQueryClient that adds Tanstack query to your tests, also globals are turned for Vitest.

```typescript
// Example test using Vitest with render-with-router
import { renderWithRouter } from ".";
import { useRouter } from "@tanstack/react-router";

const TestComponent = () => {
  const _router = useRouter({ warn: true });

  return <div>TestComponent</div>;
};

describe('Button', () => {
  it('renders correctly', () => {
    { user } = renderWithRouter(TestComponent, { withUser: true, withQueryClient: true });
    user.click('button');
  });
});
```

## üõ†Ô∏è Tools and Libraries for React Development

[shadcn/ui](https://ui.shadcn.com/c): A modern library that combines design tokens and utility classes for rapid UI development.

### ORMs

[Prisma](https://www.prisma.io/): A powerful ORM for working with databases, enabling type-safe queries and schema migrations.

[Drizzle](https://orm.drizzle.team/): A lightweight ORM alternative that offers a simpler API for SQL databases.

### Headless UI Components

[Radix UI](https://www.radix-ui.com/): A library of low-level, unstyled UI components for accessibility and customization.

[Headless UI](https://headlessui.com/): Tailored for React and Vue, it provides accessible, unstyled components that work seamlessly with TailwindCSS.

## ‚ö†Ô∏è Limitations and Known Issues

- React 19 just released, there could be dependency issues
- Some features might be experimental, they are tested before benign added to the template but still be careful.

## LLM Assisted Development

Most of tanstack libraries work really well with LLMs, here is a quick link to how to setup the rules from their docs.
